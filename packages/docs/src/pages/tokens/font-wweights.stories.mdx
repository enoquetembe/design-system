## How to Use

To apply these font weights to your project, import the font weight tokens from the Enoque UI package and use them in your styles or components:

```jsx
import { fontWeights } from 'enoque-ui/tokens';

const styles = {
  boldText: {
    fontWeight: fontWeights.bold,
  },

    fontWeight: fontWeights.regular,
  },
};
